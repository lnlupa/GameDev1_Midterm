This level contains the Unity starter 3rd person player, 
a sample enemy soldier from the pack we used in class,
and a set of Unity-produced 3D foods to use as collectibles.
The player is completely functional (as far as I know) and has a simple roughed out HUD
with text boxes to contain Lives and Collectibles/Food.
I'm picturing a game where the player is either trying to collect food items while avoiding
enemies
or the player and the enemies are racing each other to collect the food items.
